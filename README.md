# Module 11 Challenge - Note Taker with Express.js

## Challenge Details
In this challenge, we were asked to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses Express.js back end and saves and retrieves notes data from a JSON file.

Once on the notes page, notes can be typed in, saved, and will appear on the left-hand column. When those notes are clicked on the left-hand column, they will again appear to the right, with expanded details.

When the delete icon is clicked, the note will be removed from the left-hand column. To add additional notes, the user can click on the plus sign in the upper right hand corner and a new note field will appear.
